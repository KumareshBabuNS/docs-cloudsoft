##<a id="service"></a> Add a Service

Operators can use the Cloudsoft Service Broker to create two kinds of services:

* **Database Access**: Creating a database access service enables the Cloudsoft Service Broker to securely access data from a pre-existing database.
* **AMP Service**: Creating an AMP service requires a blueprint for the Cloudsoft Application Management Platform (AMP). You can use an existing blueprint or write your own from Apache Brooklyn entities such as Cassandra, CouchBase, CouchDB, ElasticSearch, MongoDB, Redis, Riak, MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and more. For more information, see the [Writing Application Blueprints](http://docs.cloudsoft.io/blueprints/index.html) topic in the Cloudsoft documentation.
